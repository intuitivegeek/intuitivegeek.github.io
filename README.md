An engaging education marketplace where high school students can explore careers and find educational options based on their profile and interests.  Sifting through thousands of educational options is a daunting task, especially for low-income and first-generation students who may not have the access to informed parents or family members. In addition to the traditional Colleges our solution surfaces viable educational options such as online education,hybrid,and apprenticeshipsthat may otherwise go unnoticed by the student. 

Students will be asked to enter the minimum information such as high school graduation date, location, and career interest. The application will display between 3 and 5 options based on the student's profile and our proprietary algorithm. Students will review and swipe left to reject the option or swipe right to indicate they are interested. Students will be asked to create an account when they are ready to save their choices to a list.
